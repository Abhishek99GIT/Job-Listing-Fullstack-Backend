This is the Backend part of my Joblisting project. 
I used Spring Framework to write 3 main API's connecting to my MongoDB database.
API's written: Get all jobs, search jobs(I used a pipeline on MongoDB to filter the jobposts based on job attributes).
I used Swagger to test my APIs. Added Mongo data and swagger2 dependencies in my pom.xml file.
If you to checkout my code, you have to use your own database since my api only connects to my database if its from my ipaddress.
